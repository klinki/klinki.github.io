title: Trying Jekyll as new blog engine
---

I just created this blog using Jekyll and GitHub pages. I hope it was the right choice and I will be happy with Jekyll. 

I plan to write about software development in general. I'm very interested in runtime systems, so I will write something about Java and .NET soon. 
I also love computer science in general, so maybe I will write about some stuff I learned in school too.
