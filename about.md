My name is David Klingenberg and I'm a Software Developer. I love Computer Science and I'm not afraid of low level programming. I got my hands dirty even on some Assembly code.

My favourite programming language is C#, but I also love C++. I like to program in all different kinds of programming languages in general, basically from C to Smalltalk :) Currently I'm profesionally working with TypeScript, JavaScript and Java.
