## Current Angular issues

1. Application architecture - how to decouple components from Router and related dependencies?
2. Loading state - how to have some universal loading state for all components and not repeat loading checks everywhere?
3. Async form field validation - how to add debounce to async form validation? Issues with race conditions of async/sync validators and so on..
4. Whole form validation - how to validate entire form, not just form field?
5. Redirect after login - how to redirect to previously visited route after login? (Related more to Keycloak than angular...)
