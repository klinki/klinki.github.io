## Git Tips

In this post, I would like to explain some tips on successful git workflow.

### Feature branches

Feature branches is very common and I think one of most important concepts of successful git workflow.

### Single purpose commit

I believe every commit in git should have single (and clear) purpose and should leave code in stable state. I must confess I'm still strugling with achieving that, but I believe it should be ultimate goal and would improve git experience. In case of regression, it would simplify finding out which commit broke the code and also simplify fixing it. (In worst case reverting the commit, in other cases creating bugfix commit). 

It might sound like like clear and very obvious (samozrejmy) thing, but it is not. I have seen (and done) many commits.

### Descriptive commit message
