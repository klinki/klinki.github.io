I'm experiencing some Jekyll related issues. I'm trying to get docker image up and running on my machine, but it doesn't seem to work properly. Currently generated pages look differently then they look live on github pages. And also the watch mode doesn't work and I have to restart docker container all the time, when I want to rebuild the site. I also have to delete already generated files.

I believe these are just temporary birth issues and won't be blocking me for long.
