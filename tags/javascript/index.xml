      <description>On my last project I had a chance to work with Aurelia. I needed to use some frontend framework capable of being easily used with existing server rendered application. This single requirement automatically crossed out Angular, so I had to look for some alternative. Since I knew little bit about Aurelia and I found out it is easily embeddable ito existing app, I decided to use it.
I think it was right decision and it has been quite pleasant to work with Aurelia.</description>
